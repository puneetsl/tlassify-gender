2013-11-24 07:18:05,Maybe Billy Bob IS his last name.
2013-11-24 07:14:42,"The back of his jersey says ""BILLY BOB"". He wears #69, naturally. BILLYBOB69 is a Hotmail account, not a football jersey."
2013-11-24 07:13:26,Watching Varsity Blues on the bus. There's a character named Billy Bob who doesn't seem to have a last name. Commentators call him Billy Bob

2013-11-23 13:21:53,@patmuldowney For me it's usually a DM that I've already checked on mobile. Nothing two or three refreshes and checks won't do away with.
2013-11-23 06:32:50,"@ThomasDrance ...and yes, it's now ""the Welsh trade"", haha"
2013-11-23 06:32:28,"@ThomasDrance It's best for his development to have gone back to Junior, but it's a shame the Welsh trade meant he didn't even get a game."
2013-11-23 06:30:55,@Shovelshark It just looks so cheap. Even the new stuff. I have an easier time suspending my disbelief for episodes of Star Trek: TOS.
2013-11-23 06:27:41,@ThomasDrance he good
2013-11-23 06:19:58,"Shots were 17-1 in the second for Dawson Creek, and 17-3 in the third. It wasn't close. McCallum, Hubert and Krantz with multi-goal evenings"

2013-11-22 22:44:55,"@hurrrdurrr Except he keeps raving about building subways to the city's outskirts, which will be hideously expensive and will require taxes."

2013-11-22 20:42:18,"@JustinTillyer its horror is rooted in the baggage of a post-WW2 Japan. It's trying to say something, whereas HG is just ""Isn't this cool?"""
2013-11-22 20:40:15,"@JustinTillyer My biggest problem with the first is it's too clean and not really about anything. Battle Royale is a disturbing movie, but.."
2013-11-22 20:37:33,"@JustinTillyer And while the movie ends on something of a cliffhanger, it's very satisfying."
2013-11-22 20:35:17,"@JustinTillyer There's a lot of set-up for future installments of course, but it's actually interesting and carries weight this time out."
2013-11-22 20:18:21,"@thordiakow Rare that a movie like this can hit me with a ""twist"" ending that is an actual surprise. I can't wait to see where it goes next."
2013-11-22 20:12:46,"Not a huge compliment there considering the first Hunger Games was a bland and boring bag of garbage, but still. Sequel was very very good."
2013-11-22 20:11:34,Catching Fire is significantly improved over its predecessor in pretty well every measurable way. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.

2013-11-20 08:27:49,"@MikeRoe But yeah, the best thing is that Taylor made Asgard feel much dirtier, more expansive, and lived-in. More a place, less a set."
2013-11-20 08:26:56,"@MikeRoe It's a lot of clunky exposition and techno-babble for teleporter stuff, which I can forgive if only because the finale is SO good."
2013-11-20 08:22:00,@MikeRoe The first one was my second-favourite of the Phase One films behind the first Iron Man. Surprising amount of comedy in both.
