2012-10-15 19:16:07,@Bethenny I guess a career as a Drag Queen is out
2012-10-15 19:03:37,@TheEllenShow My favorite was the time you gave all your Twitter followers a new Porsche
2012-10-15 17:38:37,"@Bethenny I've always wondered, do you pick your dress yourself or does Bravo have a vast warehouse full of jewel toned gowns to pick from?"

2012-10-15 14:37:59,@michellevisage So basically Catwoman
2012-10-15 13:01:26,@Bethenny Fame is a drug just like any other. Most of the time it's just sad the lengths some people go to for attention

2012-10-14 01:53:36,@IMKristenBell This is obviously a conspiracy. Veronica Mars should investigate.
2012-10-14 01:51:38,@robdelaney You should make more and sell them on Etsy

2012-10-12 01:27:15,@Bethenny He may not be an idiot but he is an ignorant bigot
2012-10-12 01:18:58,"@Bethenny I dunno, have you seen Ryan's workout photos? He seems pretty tough, I'd be scared if I were Biden #JustKidding"
2012-10-12 00:40:36,@ladygaga Such a cocktease
2012-10-12 00:39:01,@BravoAndy I refuse to even watch this mess. Biden is gonna make an ass of himself and Ryan will make me want to hurl an object at the TV

2012-10-05 00:53:33,@1capplegate I adore Up All Night! Everyone on the show is hilarious. Does it count if I watch on DVR so I can skip commercials?
2012-10-05 00:50:18,@Bethenny Maybe living in Cali would be less stressful? You always seem happier when you're there and you can live in NY when on hiatus

2012-10-04 01:52:39,@joshwolfcomedy I would like Mitt way more if I thought he was stoned. I still wouldn't vote for him though...

2012-09-25 16:11:16,@JacLaurita I can't believe you didn't start laughing at Teresa's nonsense. I love how she looks like a Disney villain in confessional too
2012-09-25 15:41:26,@jiffywild Was that your first homosexual experience? Beside the time @ChrisFranjola ate a sandwich out of your ass...
2012-09-25 02:45:19,I like Tumblr because it's for people who can't read good #PrettyPictures

2012-09-24 17:51:44,"@sceneofchangery Me too, I will be real pissed if that turns out to be the case. It's not supposed to be a happy ending either way though"

2012-09-22 03:09:58,@robdelaney Will you do the sex?
2012-09-22 01:48:01,"@sarahcolonna I used to collect keychains too, my fav was Pussy Wagon from Kill Bill This is funny cause I dont have a wagon and I like peen"
2012-09-22 01:38:28,@ian8inchlynch One of the worlds premiere sluts calling gays slutty is kind of redundant
2012-09-22 01:37:09,@SusanSarandon @AnaGasteyer @JeremySisto Finally saw Robot &amp; Frank. Brilliant and very funny! One of my favorite movies this year
2012-09-21 23:27:40,@robdelaney It would be more Jewey with a rhinestone Star of David on the lid
2012-09-21 23:16:22,@ian8inchlynch I see what you did there
2012-09-21 23:13:06,@nodoubt I like that Gravity has bits of @msolveig in there. Perhaps he should do a remix?
2012-09-21 22:03:00,"@ChrisFranjola @ryanbasford Well you don't wipe your ass the wrong way, so you have that going for you"
2012-09-21 20:30:01,".@ladygaga Are you kidding me? $200 for 300 Level seating, that's more than I paid for Madonna. I love you but that's ridiculous"

2012-09-21 15:58:26,.@PerezHilton @ParisHilton @GLAAD She's still an idiot.
2012-09-21 15:58:02,@jennafischer I just want a Jim and Pam spinoff show. Can we make that happen please?
2012-09-21 15:22:11,@jujuboston Wine + Vodka = Worst Hangover Ever
2012-09-21 12:08:29,I don't really care all that much about the iPhone 5. Does that mean I'm going to hell?
2012-09-21 03:00:34,"@1capplegate I missed this show so much! Your new brother is cute, Will got real hot over the summer, you and Eva are the bestest"

2012-09-20 17:35:33,@PerezHilton @ParisHilton Why is the world still giving this moron any attention?
2012-09-20 17:34:37,.@ParisHilton You do realize you're an idiot right? Most gays do not have AIDS. We're not all coke sluts like you. Shut your face.

2012-09-19 18:57:19,"@sarahcolonna Can't we just force the two of them,  and the Kardashians onto a deserted island surrounded by sharks?"
2012-09-19 17:51:51,@sethmeyers21 Only if you promise special guest stars galore (I will watch regardless)
2012-09-19 15:55:41,@BeckiNewton I will give you a dollar if you dress up as Amanda and put on a weekly web series following her exploits post Ugly Betty
2012-09-19 15:47:20,@robdelaney Investing in Facebook stock?
2012-09-19 15:20:47,@PerezHilton Can't we just force them to duke it out Mortal Kombat style on a deserted island somewhere?
2012-09-19 14:19:15,@sarahcolonna It's really sad the lengths some people will go to for attention
2012-09-19 13:31:55,I'm getting exhausted just thinking about how much energy Lindsay Lohan must spend being such a disaster...

2012-09-19 01:22:52,@robdelaney @capo_of_clifton HELL NO! Voting is important!

2012-09-18 15:31:32,@MittRomney Is it possible for you to just not be an asshole?
2012-09-18 12:18:02,"Pity Party for one, your table is now available"
2012-09-18 12:15:22,I wish I could sit down to a nice tic tac dinner with @RuPaul I need some sense smacked into me
2012-09-18 01:34:41,@CaroleRadziwill I feel like that needs to be on a t-shirt. I want one
2012-09-18 01:32:49,@Bethenny So does this mean you'll be relocating to the west coast full time?
2012-09-18 01:26:42,@TommyDefendi A for effort. P for penis
2012-09-18 01:22:33,"@JeremySisto The words ""butt padding"" are the opposite of sexy. Just so you know."
2012-09-18 01:08:15,RT @Jessicats8: Shut-up about your babies! My cats doing something super cute like sleeping in a hamper.
2012-09-17 19:49:06,RT @thegarethmclean: I'd imagine the worst thing ever would be being brought up by two Rupert Everetts.
2012-09-17 17:09:22,Sometimes I wish the Point of View gun from Hitchhikers Guide were real. It would solve a lot of arguements in our house
2012-09-17 15:59:16,@RuPaul I would rather have my daydreams become reality. A giant mansion filled with hot dudes and money sounds better than imaginary fears
2012-09-17 12:21:51,If my office wants me to be more productive they should probably not have it be warmer in the bathroom than at my desk
2012-09-17 11:00:54,"@ElizabethBanks Pause for dramatic effect, or something..."
2012-09-17 02:34:05,"@CarolineManzo @cafface That is really pretty, excellent job"
2012-09-16 16:16:35,i think we can all agree that Gangnam Style is the *best song ever created. *best - meaning terrible piece of crap
2012-09-15 23:50:54,"@sarahcolonna So is responding with ""Who is this?"" the next time they text you"
2012-09-15 22:03:49,"@Bethenny They are the worst! Put saran wrap over bowl filled with cider vinegar &amp; dish soap, poke holes and set out. It'll kill a bunch"
2012-09-15 19:39:14,@dinamanzo I like to save Dina's Party for a relaxing afternoon on the couch. It makes me giggle &amp; also wish my apartment was more sparkly
