2013-10-01 23:37:46,@YoshiTweets they were gonna get another season!! I think if they did give it another season they could have some cool stories too..
2013-10-01 23:37:17,@YoshiTweets um yeah! Esp the part where the model was nowhere to be found AND how the host showed up! It made NO sense &amp; they def thought

2013-09-26 22:27:06,@YoshiTweets there needed to be more of a twist! like druglord money or something shady going on! I read they gave it another season too!

2013-06-03 02:44:40,@YoshiTweets Remember in season 2 when we were like why are they making such a big deal of that. It must be b/c it can kill white walkers
2013-06-03 02:44:08,@YoshiTweets I think it's because he had that special steel or whatever that they found buried in the snow with the watch
2013-06-03 02:37:43,@YoshiTweets if the whole finale is that dumb stannis and melissandre it's gonna suck!! and wtf is the deal with bran? They need to explain!

2013-06-03 02:10:22,@YoshiTweets Also btw Dany's new solider is Julie's man! Aka Young Fabio! hahahha!!
2013-06-03 02:10:00,@YoshiTweets I CAN'T WITH IT!! That episode was some straight BS!!! How are they gonna kill those characters!!!
