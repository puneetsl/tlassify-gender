Wed Mar 19 06:12:16 +0000 2014,But gotta say, I have a way with words 👌
Wed Mar 19 06:11:55 +0000 2014,Lmfao let me take my little insightful ass back to sleep,
Wed Mar 19 06:09:53 +0000 2014,Always wondering if you regret things, but those who regret don't learn how to live. Living with no regret feels so much better,
Wed Mar 19 06:07:58 +0000 2014,Sleep seems like such a wasted thing when you have so much on your mind that is yet to be sorted out.
Wed Mar 19 06:02:23 +0000 2014,Lmfao why am I saying all this shit. My non-caring ass, I know better than to let you be the source of my negativeness. Bitch ass boy
Wed Mar 19 06:00:35 +0000 2014,You are such a dumb fuck for thinking I wouldn't find out you were doing me wrong. I'm smarter than that👏👏
Wed Mar 19 05:55:20 +0000 2014,My tweets at night are always the most insightful &amp; meaningful.

Wed Mar 19 05:52:11 +0000 2014,You knew exactly what you were doing though. Making me feel like it was us against the world then turning around &amp; making it you against me.
Wed Mar 19 05:50:57 +0000 2014,I should have known you'd walk away, be faithful didn't suit you anyway.
Wed Mar 19 05:49:38 +0000 2014,Forever wondering if what we had was real, or if it was all in my head &amp; I was just another player in something you thought was a game.
Wed Mar 19 05:47:23 +0000 2014,Like okay I'm awake now, wtf ugh
