Mon Mar 10 19:41:54 +0000 2014,@loxyisme My blood has adjusted to the point where -10 feels hot to me.
Mon Mar 10 19:41:35 +0000 2014,@loxyisme Well you're from Edmonton right? I would hope it would be no big deal, I can't imagine it's worse than there. Or Chetwynd, even.
Mon Mar 10 19:37:29 +0000 2014,@loxyisme It's a really wet, humid heat too. Montreal gets it worse though.
Sun Mar 09 16:22:00 +0000 2014,@kerrrrrrrr It waits for all men.
Sun Mar 09 10:24:43 +0000 2014,@mattwpo My favourite joke from a Groening show is the robot-boxing Futurama. "As a head without a body, I envy the dead!" Slays every time.
Sun Mar 09 10:21:48 +0000 2014,@mattwpo Bake em away, toys.
Sun Mar 09 10:19:59 +0000 2014,@mattwpo The one where they live on a houseboat to escape Sideshow Bob. The Thompsons. I dunno the name of it. Great ep.
Sun Mar 09 09:48:34 +0000 2014,@mattwpo It's a bold contender for sure, but I still defer to Monorail.
Sun Mar 09 09:38:22 +0000 2014,@kerrrrrrrr Having to stay up til 1:05 every night to watch The Daily Show for the last 6 months has been, to be frank, fucked up and rude.
Sun Mar 09 09:37:31 +0000 2014,@kerrrrrrrr As someone who lives in a downright bizarre area of the world that does not acknowledge DST, I envy you.
Sat Mar 08 21:59:19 +0000 2014,@BakesTakes84 If they were going to model the rebuild on the Flames, the rebuild wouldn't actually start for another six years.
Sat Mar 08 21:13:35 +0000 2014,"Hi, is Champ there? Champ. Can I talk to Champ?" "Who is Champ?" "WE'LL FIND OUT THIS SUNDAY WHEN JOHN CENA"
Sat Mar 08 21:12:23 +0000 2014,I'm worried this video will give me an aneurism from laughing too hard. Radio prank-calls woman with WWE PPV offers: http://t.co/2Y4I95xky6
Sat Mar 08 07:13:04 +0000 2014,@oldmanweldon Maybe it's just me but for me it's gotta be Syriana.
Sat Mar 08 04:24:34 +0000 2014,@ggiannakos Eva Green chews the scenery and partakes in perhaps the funniest sex scene of all time. I mean, that alone...
Sat Mar 08 01:41:00 +0000 2014,@seancooley This was riveting, thank you.
Sat Mar 08 01:09:37 +0000 2014,@nikonrachel It's definitely a favourite, I wear it much too much.
Sat Mar 08 01:03:06 +0000 2014,Upside to your favorite sports club filling you with despair? The game that's supposed to distract you from your life makes it seem not bad.
Sat Mar 08 00:25:47 +0000 2014,@sbellelauren A google image search for "dog lion" brings a startling amount of animal cruelty from ironic owners.
Fri Mar 07 23:33:58 +0000 2014,By all accounts, 300: Rise of an Empire is a terrible movie with a legendarily hilarious sex scene. May have to see this crapfest after all.
Fri Mar 07 22:06:44 +0000 2014,@patersonjeff But you're right, it's a sad state of affairs when these things are true.
Fri Mar 07 22:06:25 +0000 2014,@patersonjeff In this year's Canuck yearbook, he's Player Most Likely To Score A Nice Goal. Kass/Booth have been solid most nights, of late.
Fri Mar 07 21:58:48 +0000 2014,@patersonjeff He's about their only entertaining player right now. SSPN makes no difference in outcomes, but I'm less likely to turn on TV.
Fri Mar 07 07:00:33 +0000 2014,@JoshuaLeeCoss Think of your three best attributes. Now, think of how you acquired them all from someone else.
Fri Mar 07 06:44:00 +0000 2014,First play rehearsal tonight. Director tells men, "...you might want to think about growing beards." Yeah, I might. http://t.co/mWJe0k0fWW

Fri Mar 07 01:26:54 +0000 2014,@jessespector I don't know what show you're seeing (if any), but my god, Ryan Hamilton is hilarious.
Fri Mar 07 00:39:47 +0000 2014,Two faults: He eventually retired. RT @CCtsn: Nick Lidstrom had only one fault as a player. He made it look too easy.
Fri Mar 07 00:14:43 +0000 2014,"Not only did you play here for your entire Hall of Fame career, but you're also lucky caller ,97!!"
Fri Mar 07 00:13:54 +0000 2014,I love it when sports teams reward players whose numbers they are retiring with a little vacation, like they also won a radio contest.
Thu Mar 06 23:24:36 +0000 2014,The man deserves the biggest audience possible. It's hard to think of anyone who makes me laugh more consistently than he does.
Thu Mar 06 23:22:44 +0000 2014,People used to always ask me who I got to meet while I was working in LA, and I would always gush about Andy Daly to mostly blank faces.
Thu Mar 06 23:19:32 +0000 2014,.@TVsAndyDaly's "Review" finally premieres on Comedy Central tonight, which makes today about as exciting as Christmas Day for comedy fans.
Thu Mar 06 20:44:48 +0000 2014,@hurrrdurrr I wouldn't exactly call Joe Warmington a "journalist".
Thu Mar 06 17:44:59 +0000 2014,@ThomasDrance "As you can see from the jersey hanging over the pool table in my rec room, I played there. Therefore..."

Wed Mar 05 22:03:51 +0000 2014,@rollingpucks Guy gets more ice than any forward in the league. Unreal.
Wed Mar 05 22:00:25 +0000 2014,@rollingpucks That tweet just made me hate a player who's been my favourite for a decade. What does he have to gripe about?
Wed Mar 05 21:54:36 +0000 2014,Wow. RT @Ryan_Kesler: "Told you so" - @strombone1  ☔️
Wed Mar 05 20:47:05 +0000 2014,@ericasia Glendale and Scottsdale just kinda look like that.
Wed Mar 05 20:04:44 +0000 2014,@hosea24hours NYR pays Vancouver a fifth round pick for taking Weise off waivers.
Wed Mar 05 19:44:46 +0000 2014,He just fell for a fake report. RT @provincesports: We can confirm that is the real @benkuzma Twitter account.
Wed Mar 05 19:43:31 +0000 2014,Stumbling block in Kesler trade remains Gillis' insistence that patented expanding hose comes back in the deal. "He promised we'll love it!"
Wed Mar 05 19:33:54 +0000 2014,What do you mean, "yesterday"? RT @THNMattLarkin: Tim Thomas trade is karma punishing Twitter for all the lame tire pumping jokes yesterday.
