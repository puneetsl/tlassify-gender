  fashionista if it's the right topic
 maddiriley i want one I'll bring you money
 fashionista cool that you're applying there  What do you want to study
 fashionista also FIT was my dream school all through middle school and freshman year when I really wanted to be a designs so thats so
  fashionista you want to do and you have a story to tell about why
 fashionista I got into the four I applied to with that essay  I think thats a great topic  It helps prove that youve thought about what
  fashionista don't be nervous about it
  fashionista significant I just wrote about concerts and how when I'm at one I feel like I'm at home and nothing else matters
 fashionista that's all so subjective  You can easily write about something small and personal rather than setting stereotypically
  fashionista I wrote mine about concerts  They don't have to be life changing events
