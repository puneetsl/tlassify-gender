397600966834671616,2013-11-05 05:47:12,But I feel like no one can REALLY appreciate good music until you try to write your own. Then you realize how much it actually takes.
397600305497784321,2013-11-05 05:44:34,THEN releasing the track and getting all this awesome feedback from friends and fans is the most awesome part about making music.
397600154389606400,2013-11-05 05:43:58,Then finishing the track is also awesome  too.
397600037808930816,2013-11-05 05:43:30,"Until you sit down and try to produce a first track, no one will ever understand what it is like."
